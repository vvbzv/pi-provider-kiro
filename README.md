# pi-provider-kiro

A [pi](https://shittycodingagent.ai/) provider extension that connects pi to the **Kiro API** (AWS CodeWhisperer/Q), exposing **12 kiro-cli-verified models** through one provider surface.

## Why this exists

Kiro gives you a strong free model menu, but pi needs a provider that speaks Kiro's auth, model catalog, and streaming protocol cleanly. `pi-provider-kiro` handles that bridge, including:

- AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity Center, Google, GitHub (headless device flow), and enterprise external IdP (OIDC) login flows
- shared credentials from an existing `kiro-cli` session when available
- reasoning-aware streaming
- region-aware model filtering so pi only shows models your Kiro region can actually use

## Quick start

Install the provider:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-kiro
```

Or install it globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g pi-provider-kiro
```

Then log in from pi:

```text
/login kiro
```

The login flow supports:
- **AWS Builder ID** — native device-code flow, works well over SSH/remotes
- **Your organization** — IAM Identity Center start URL
- **Google / GitHub (device flow)** — native device-code login: approve a code on any device. Works headless (SSH, containers, JupyterLab), no `kiro-cli` required
- **Web Login** — browser-redirect PKCE login with a localhost callback; use it when the browser runs on the same machine as pi

If your organization uses an external identity provider (e.g. Okta) through Kiro, log in once with
`kiro-cli login` and the provider reuses that session — no separate pi login needed.

If you already use [kiro-cli](https://kiro.dev), the provider can reuse those credentials instead of forcing a second login.

### Headless / remote login (SSH, containers, JupyterLab)

For Google or GitHub on a machine with no browser, pick **Google (device flow)** or
**GitHub (device flow)** in the login menu:

```text
/login kiro   →  pick "Google (device flow)"

URL:  https://app.kiro.dev/account/device?user_code=XXXX-XXXX&login_provider=Google
Code: XXXX-XXXX  —  open the URL on any device (phone, laptop, another tab) and confirm
```

The flow talks to Kiro's social auth service directly — no localhost callback and no
`kiro-cli` install required. Use **Web Login** instead when the browser runs on the
same machine as pi.

All listed models are free to use through Kiro.

## Usage

Once logged in, select any Kiro model in pi:

```text
/model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Or let Kiro pick automatically:

```text
/model auto
```

Reasoning is automatically enabled for supported models. Use `/reasoning` to adjust the thinking budget.

### Estimated usage

Kiro reports an exact credit count for completed turns, but not a per-turn USD charge. It also currently omits the cache-read and cache-write fields modeled by its token-usage response. Both estimates are independently opt-in:

```json
{
  "pi-provider-kiro": {
    "usageTracking": {
      "estimateDollarValue": true,
      "estimateCacheUsage": true,
      "estimatedCacheTimeout": 300000
    }
  }
}
```

`estimateDollarValue` converts credits to an estimated USD-equivalent value for Pi usage dashboards. `usdPerCredit` defaults to Kiro's published add-on rate of `$0.04` per credit and may be overridden. The legacy `enabled: true` setting remains accepted as a deprecated alias for `estimateDollarValue: true`.

`estimateCacheUsage` conservatively reclassifies prompt tokens repeated from the previous successful turn in the same session as `cacheRead`. The first turn, large context reductions, idle gaps beyond `estimatedCacheTimeout`, and any response carrying real wire cache counters remain untouched. The timeout defaults to five minutes; set it to `0` to disable expiry. Estimated messages include `usage.cacheEstimated: true` so audits can distinguish estimates from provider-reported values.

These values are estimates, not wire truth, invoices, or confirmed marginal charges. Credits included in a subscription may have no marginal cost, and estimated cache usage does not prove that Kiro served a backend cache hit. Tracking is disabled by default, and invalid settings fail closed for the affected estimate. Pi's HTML session export currently recomputes component costs and may therefore show `$0`; cost dashboards and summaries that read `usage.cost.total` show the dollar-value estimate.

### Usage in the footer

Opt in to a compact allowance indicator in Pi's footer while a Kiro model is active:

```json
{
  "pi-provider-kiro": {
    "showUsageInFooter": true
  }
}
```

The badge shows the percent of your allowance **used** (e.g. `◆ Kiro 1%`), colored by consumption — comfortable below 70%, warning at 70%, and critical at 90%. It refreshes on session start, model switches, and after completed Kiro turns, throttled to avoid extra requests. It stays hidden for non-Kiro models, when no local Kiro credential is available, or if a usage lookup fails, and is disabled by default.

## Retry Behavior

Generic transient retries such as HTTP `429` and `5xx` are handled by `pi-coding-agent` at the session layer.

This provider only keeps local recovery for Kiro-specific cases:
- `403` auth races, where it can refresh credentials from `kiro-cli`
- first-token / stalled-stream recovery
- empty-stream retries
- non-retryable Kiro body markers like `MONTHLY_REQUEST_COUNT` and `INSUFFICIENT_MODEL_CAPACITY`

The reason codes this provider classifies on are published from the package
entry point, so consumers can interpret a code without hardcoding their own copy
of the literals:

```ts
import {
  KIRO_REASON_CODES,
  isCapacityError,
  isNonRetryableBodyError,
  isTooBigError,
} from "pi-provider-kiro";

isTooBigError(400, body); // size rejection → safe to compact and retry
isCapacityError(body); // transient capacity → safe to retry as-is
isNonRetryableBodyError(body); // hard quota → do not retry
```

These are Kiro's own codes, not a provider taxonomy: mapping them to your own
semantics is the consumer's job.

One caveat for consumers outside pi: the entry point is the whole provider, so
importing it loads modules that import pi's host packages
(`@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `-pi-coding-agent`, `-pi-tui`). They are declared as
optional peer dependencies — present already wherever this runs as a pi
extension, but a standalone project must install them itself or the import fails
with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The types resolve without them under the usual
`skipLibCheck`.

## Development

```bash
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript
npm run check       # Type check (no emit)
npm test            # Run the Vitest suite
npm run test:watch  # Watch mode
```

## Architecture

The extension is organized as one feature per file:

```
src/
├── index.ts            # Extension registration
├── models.ts           # 12 model definitions + ID resolution
├── oauth.ts            # Multi-provider auth (Builder ID / Google / GitHub)
├── kiro-cli.ts         # kiro-cli credential sharing
├── transform.ts        # Message format conversion
├── history.ts          # Conversation history management
├── thinking-parser.ts  # Streaming <thinking> tag parser
├── token-type.ts       # `tokentype` header for external IdP bearer tokens
├── event-parser.ts     # Kiro stream event parser
└── stream.ts           # Main streaming orchestrator
```
